# Task 1: Collapsible Sidebar

![Screenshot of the project](task1.png)

## Description

This project implements a **collapsible sidebar** that smoothly opens and closes when the user clicks a toggle button.  
The sidebar includes a logo placeholder, navigation links with icons, and a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

It’s a simple yet practical exercise to practice **component layout**, **toggle logic**, and **animations** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page  
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript**: Toggle logic for sidebar open/close animation  
- **Font Awesome**: For icons inside the sidebar links  

---

## Features

- Collapsible sidebar with smooth animation  
- Clean and modern layout  
- Fully responsive — works well on mobile and desktop  
- Simple toggle button to open or close the sidebar  
- Custom colors and consistent design  

---

## How It Works

1. Click the **Menu** button to toggle the sidebar.  
2. When the sidebar opens:
   - It slides in smoothly from the left.
   - The main content shifts to the right.
3. When it closes:
   - It slides out again.
   - The main content returns to its normal position.

The sidebar width adjusts automatically based on the screen size — **250px** for desktops and **200px** for mobile devices.
