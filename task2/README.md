![Screenshot of the project](task2.png)

## Description

This project implements a **responsive contact form** that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.  
The form includes fields for **Full Name, Email Address, Subject, and Message**, along with a **Submit** button.  

It’s a practical exercise to practice **form layout**, **responsive design**, and **basic JavaScript validation** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## How It Works

1. Fill in all the required fields: Full Name, Email, Subject, and Message.  
2. Click the **Submit** button.  
3. JavaScript validation checks:
   - Full Name, Subject, and Message are not empty.  
   - Email is in a valid format.  
4. If any field is invalid:
   - An error message appears below the corresponding input.  
5. If all fields are valid:
   - The form resets.  
   - A success dialog appears confirming submission.  
6. Close the dialog by clicking the **Close** button.

The form layout adapts automatically to screen size, ensuring usability across all devices.
